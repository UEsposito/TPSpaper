# TPSpaper
Code to reproduce the results shown in the paper Esposito et al.

There are 3 folders:
  - data/ contains the excel file that holds the input data to TPS
  - src/ contains the Matlab scripts necessary to run TPS and to reproduce the results of the paper
  - results/ contains the output of TPS: an excel table, png figures, and a mat file
  
  To run TPS use the function Paper_results_main.m. This is the main function which loads the excel file in data/.
