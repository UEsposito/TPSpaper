# TPS paper
TPS is a method to date ancient genomes solely from their genomic sequence.
In the following we provide the code to reproduce the results reported by Esposito et al.'s study

There are 3 folders:
  - data/ contains the excel file with the input data for TPS
  - src/ contains the Matlab scripts necessary to run TPS and to reproduce the results of the study
  - results/ contains the output of TPS: an excel table, png figures, and a mat file
  
  To run TPS use the function Paper_results_main.m. This is the main function which loads the excel file in data/.
